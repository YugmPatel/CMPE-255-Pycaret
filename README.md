# **PyCaret Low-Code Machine Learning - Google Colab Project**

## **Project Overview**

This project demonstrates how to use PyCaret's low-code machine learning library in Google Colab. The Colab notebooks cover various tasks in PyCaret, ranging from model building, clustering, anomaly detection, association rule mining, and time series forecasting.

Each Colab notebook is accompanied by a brief video tutorial that explains the task in detail, running in my own Colab environment.

## **Contents**

Below is a list of all Colab notebooks included in this project, with a brief description of each task.

## **How to Run the Notebooks**

1. **Open Google Colab**: Each notebook is hosted on Google Colab. You can access it by clicking on the provided "Colab Link" in the table above.
2. **Run the Notebook**: After the notebook is loaded, simply click on **Runtime > Run all** to execute all the cells.
3. **Environment Setup**: Make sure to install PyCaret and any other necessary dependencies.

## **Video Tutorials**

For each notebook, there is a corresponding video tutorial that explains the purpose of the notebook and walks you through running it. The videos can be accessed via the "Video Tutorial" links in the table above.
